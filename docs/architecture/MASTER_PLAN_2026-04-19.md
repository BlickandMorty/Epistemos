## 2 · Batch HH — URGENT tool-path fix (in progress)

The biggest root-cause finding from Research 3: **the "find my note" / "what am I working on" failures have a single-line root cause.** Pro mode on a cloud brain drops into a path with zero tools, so GPT-5.4 hallucinates about notes it has no way to actually look up.

### HH.1 — Intent classifier nudges toward Agent mode for note lookups
`Epistemos/Engine/AgentHarness/ChatCapability.swift:141` currently has `create/delete/update/install/run/automate/send/open-the-app` in the agent-signal list but is missing the LOOKUP signals. Add: `"find the note"`, `"find a note"`, `"look up"`, `"search for"`, `"locate"`, `"show me"`, `"open the note"`, `"which note"`, `"summarize my note"`. **~10 line change.**

### HH.2 — Persist AgentAuthority decisions across launches
`Epistemos/Engine/AgentHarness/AgentAuthority.swift:152` uses `InMemoryAgentAuthorityPersistence` as the default. User allow/ask/deny choices don't survive restart. Swap to JSON-file backing keyed on a vault-relative path. **Medium, contained to one file.**

### HH.3 — Downgrade safe-write tools from Agent to ChatPro
In `agent_core/src/tools/registry.rs:483` (`apply_tier_overrides`), move `vault_write`, vault-relative `patch`, and `memory` from `Agent` to `ChatPro`. A notetaking app whose AI can't save a note from Pro mode is exactly what the user hit.

Gate: still require single-confirm on first use per session (existing AgentAuthority pattern).

### HH.4 — Pro-mode-on-cloud gets tools
`Epistemos/Engine/PipelineService.swift:302-304` — the `guard case .localMLX` gates every cloud-model Pro turn to a zero-tools direct stream. Fix: route Pro+cloud through the Rust agent loop with `ChatPro` tier (bounded `max_turns=3`, `max_tool_calls=8` — already in `ResolvedExecutionPolicy`).

`Epistemos/App/ChatCoordinator.swift:1201` — the `operatingMode == .agent` condition also needs to allow `.pro` with cloud models.

**Highest risk + highest impact of HH sub-batches.** Save for last, land behind a shadow-test that asserts Pro+cloud can emit at least one tool call on a benchmark prompt.

---

## 3 · Batch DD — native reasoning controls (in progress)

Data layer shipped as DD.1. Per the research brief, the app taxonomy is 3-tier (Off / Standard / Extended) — honest across all three providers.

### DD.2 — OpenAI wire-up
Extend `openAIResponseControls` in `LLMService.swift` to honor `inference.chatReasoningTier`:
- `.off` → `reasoning.effort: "none"`, `text.verbosity: "low"`
- `.standard` → `reasoning.effort: "medium"`, `reasoning.summary: "auto"`, `text.verbosity: "medium"`
- `.extended` → `reasoning.effort: "high"`, `reasoning.summary: "detailed"`, `text.verbosity: "high"`

Disable the control on non-reasoning models (hard 400 otherwise). Only apply on `/v1/responses` — Chat Completions rejects the nested object.

### DD.3 — Anthropic wire-up
Migrate `anthropicExtendedThinkingEnabled` + `anthropicThinkingBudgetTokens` to the tier:
- `.off` → omit `thinking`
- `.standard` → Opus 4.7+/Mythos: `thinking:{type:"adaptive", effort:"medium"}`; older: `thinking:{type:"enabled", budget_tokens: 4096}`
- `.extended` → adaptive `high`; older manual: `budget_tokens: 16000` + `anthropic-beta: interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14` header when tools are in play

Keep the existing Settings sliders visible for power users; the tier drives the default, slider overrides per chat.

### DD.4 — Google thinkingConfig (pure gap)
Add `thinkingConfig` to `generationConfig` in Google requests:
- `.off` → 3.x: `thinkingLevel:"minimal"` if supported else omit; 2.5 Flash/Lite: `thinkingBudget:0`; 2.5 Pro: not supported
- `.standard` → 3.x: `thinkingLevel:"medium"`; 2.5: `thinkingBudget:-1` (dynamic); always `includeThoughts:true`
- `.extended` → 3.x: `thinkingLevel:"high"`; 2.5: `thinkingBudget:16384`; `includeThoughts:true`

Validate: `thinkingLevel` and `thinkingBudget` in one request is a hard 400 — pick one per model.

### DD.5 — Settings → Inference picker UI
Segmented control: Off / Standard / Extended with the `summary` string below. Per-model reasoning capability gate (disable the control with a subtitle when the active model doesn't support reasoning).

---

## 4 · Batch EE — route reasoning into the thinking popover

Batch CC stopped the OpenAI reasoning leak; the reasoning now simply drops into a void. This batch threads it back into the existing thinking popover.

- New `PipelineEvent.reasoningDelta(String)` sibling of `.textDelta`.
- `LLMService` streaming parsers surface reasoning per provider:
  - OpenAI: `openAICompatibleReasoningDelta` (already added in CC)
  - Anthropic: `content_block_delta.delta.type == "thinking_delta"` path (preserve `signature_delta` for tool continuation)
  - Google: `parts[*].thought == true` (requires `includeThoughts:true` from DD.4)
- `ChatCoordinator` routes `.reasoningDelta` → `ChatState.appendStreamingThinking` so the existing `ThinkingPopoverView` lights up.
- Live stream then collapse to "Thought for Ns" pill per research 2 consensus.

---

## 5 · Batch FF — Claude Code-style agent transparency

Inline surfaces so the user can see what the agent is doing without leaving the chat.

### FF.1 — TodoWrite sticky card
Render `TodoWrite` tool calls as a special card that sticks to the top of the current assistant turn (not just a collapsible tool card in the stream). Three states per item: pending / in_progress / done. One in-progress at a time per research 2 consensus. Strikethrough on done.

### FF.2 — Context meter bottom-bar
Per-chat bar showing `tokens used / model limit`, three-segment breakdown (system / tools / messages / free), auto-compact threshold marker. Claude Code's `/context` widget is the only documented precedent; no app does "what's about to be evicted" — that's open territory.

### FF.3 — Scratchpad as `think`-tool card
Anthropic's `think` tool already exists in `agent_core`. Render its output as a distinct "Notes to self" card type in the transcript — collapsed by default, expandable, explicitly marked as non-authoritative.

### FF.4 — Stream the thinking drawer live
Claude.ai pattern. `DisclosureGroup` that auto-expands while the assistant is thinking (shows the live stream from Batch EE), auto-collapses to "Thought for 8s" when the first text delta arrives. Already have the state on `ChatState` from Batches C/D/G — just need the animated surface.

---

## 6 · Batch GG — optional polish surfaces

Not critical for release but high-value per research 3.

### GG.1 — Embedded terminal view
PTY plumbing already exists in `omega-mcp/src/pty.rs` + `agent_core/src/pty.rs` — no UI surface today. One tab that tails the latest `terminal` tool call's stdout with ANSI rendering. Matches Cursor/Claude Code inline terminal.

### GG.2 — Bundle `rg` and `fd` binaries
For faster vault search and agent-side find operations. `search_files` uses `grep-searcher` in-process today (fine), but shelling out to `rg` via `terminal` for user-typed queries unlocks power-user speed once HH.3+HH.4 enable the terminal tool.

### GG.3 — Memory diff card
No shipping app does this today — genuine first. After each turn that updated persistent memory, render a post-turn card: "Remembered 2 new things, updated 1." Each with accept/reject/edit affordances. Anthropic's user-editable memory is the closest prior art.

### GG.4 — "Loaded vs attended" provenance
Hardest. No app ships this. Would require agent_core to annotate which context blocks it actually used per answer, then render citation-chip-links back to the attended notes. Park as R&D until attention-tracking is reliable.

---

## 7 · Deeper memory reduction (Rust-side, deferred)

Baseline is now 300MB idle (down from 741MB) — audit agent confirmed stable. Remaining 250MB reduction targets are all Rust:

- Graph engine buffer release on `pauseEngine` (80-150MB estimated)
- SearchIndex FTS5 lazy unload after N minutes idle (50-100MB)
- Rust agent_core retained sessions cleanup (variable)

These need careful Rust changes with `cargo test` validation and are deliberately after the UX priorities.

---

## 8 · Open questions for the user

These shape the implementation and should be answered before the related batches land.

1. **HH.4 risk tolerance** — Pro+cloud routing through Rust agent loop: you want this on by default, or behind a feature flag for one release cycle?
2. **FF.2 context meter position** — bottom-bar or pinned to the top of the composer? Claude Code uses a `/context` slash command; Cursor has a micro-bar in the composer footer.
3. **Reasoning tier default** — Standard (current DD.1 default) or Off so users opt in?
4. **DD.5 picker location** — Settings only, or also in the main chat picker next to the model row?

---

## 9 · What gets flagged as "fine, leave alone"

From user's own words — surfaces I'm deliberately not touching:
- **Prose editor** — "the most polished part of the app, needs to stay that way." Batches V + AA change only the paint background on dark; rendering/typing/wikilinks untouched.
- **Light mode** — "should not be changed at all." Near-OLED is dark-only; light themes fall through to existing code at every call site.
- **Graph hologram physics** — pause/resume wiring stays; no touches to the Metal/Rust render loop.
- **MLX idle unload** — already correct (1-5s delay, verified). No work needed.

---

## 10 · Commit cadence rules (reminder for future batches)

Learned from tonight's misses:
- **Never `git add <file>` without checking `git diff --staged` first** — that's how the pre-existing dirty-tree edits bundled into Batch P. Use targeted `git add -p` or stage specific hunks when a file has mixed ownership.
- **One concern per commit.** If a test breaks after landing, it's always clear which commit to revert.
- **Failed test = fix or revert, never skip.** No `--no-verify`, no test-shape relaxation without explanation.
- **User's "don't break what's polished" constraint** is load-bearing. Every batch that touches `Epistemos/Views/Notes/` specifically has to prove no prose-editor regression.

## 11 · Added 2026-04-19 evening — "app feels dead" crux

User's exact language: *"for tool use and searching things online my app does not have ui for that everything just feels dead... that is the crux of the entire plan."* The app is engineered well but invisible during the moments users most need to feel it working — tool calls, web searches, agent steps. Three linked threads:

### 11A — Capability manifest (pending research)
Research agent dispatched to answer: what shape should a dynamic capability document take so each model reads it before every turn and knows exactly what it can do right now? Candidates: markdown `.agents/CAPABILITIES.md` (Claude Code precedent), YAML per-mode, JSON injected as system prompt. Scope, format, and injection timing to be decided from the brief.

### 11B — Capability parity audit (pending research)
User wants UI for **every** capability OpenAI / Anthropic / Google expose. Research agent building a matrix: rows = capabilities (streaming / multimodal in/out / file upload / code interpreter / web browse / web fetch / computer use / document gen / tool calling / structured output / memory / projects / reasoning / agent runtime / vision / audio / TTS / batch / long context / caching / moderation / fine-tune / embeddings). Columns = providers. Plus a third pane: does Epistemos surface it today (Shipped / Engineered-but-hidden / Gap)? Ends with top-10 UI gaps ranked by impact.

### 11C — Live tool-use / web-search status UI
Right now when an agent fires a tool, the user sees roughly nothing: `activeToolName` is a string, `isAgentExecuting` is a bool, and the StreamingIndicator is a single spinner. Compared to Perplexity ("Searching 3 sources... Reading article... Synthesizing"), Claude Code (live stdout streaming), and Cursor (tool panel) — Epistemos is silent during the exact seconds it's doing the most work.

Minimum-viable "live tool status" UX to design:
- A compact narration strip above the streaming indicator: `▸ Searching your vault — "bell hooks"`
- Tool cards that animate in the moment the tool event arrives, showing args, live stdout (for shell/terminal tools), and completion state
- For web-enabled turns, a Perplexity-style "Searching / Reading / Synthesizing" narration tied to PipelineEvent types
- Sources rail — citations attach to the assistant reply inline + aggregate

Lands as Batch **FF extended** — originally planned as TodoWrite checklist + context meter, now expanded to include this live-narration + animated tool cards work.

---

## 12 · Open questions (added by user 2026-04-19 evening)

5. **Capability manifest scope** — should it be user-editable (like `.cursorrules` / `CLAUDE.md`) or auto-generated by the app from the active tier + tool toggles + configured provider, or both (auto-generated base + user-authored overrides)?
6. **Parity audit threshold** — should the app aim to expose every capability each provider offers, or a curated PKM-scoped subset (vault-read / vault-write / web search / embeddings / long context / reasoning — skip code interpreter, TTS, image gen)?
7. **Live narration verbosity** — per-step ("Searching vault → 3 hits → Reading note 1…") or summary ("Searching vault…"). Perplexity does per-step for Pro Search and summary for regular.
8. **Tool-status card permanence** — collapse to summary after completion, or keep expanded so the user can see what was run?
